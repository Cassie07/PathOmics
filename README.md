Workflow overview of the pathology-and-genomics multimodal transformer (PathOmics) for survival prediction. In (a), we show the pipeline of extracting image and genomics feature embedding via an unsupervised pretraining towards multimodal data fusion. In (b) and (c), our supervised finetuning scheme could flexibly handle mul- tiple types of data for prognostic prediction. With the multimodal pretrained model backbones, both multi- or single-modal data can be applicable for our model finetuning.
